## Introduction

Elisa is a simple music player aiming to provide a nice experience for its users.
User-facing information about the app can be found at https://apps.kde.org/elisa/.

## Contributions

Contributions are very much welcome! The process of building Elisa from source using KDE's `kdesrc-build` tool is easy and recommended. See
https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved/development/Build_software_with_kdesrc-build
for information on how to set this up.

Please send code contributions by submitting a merge request at
https://invent.kde.org/multimedia/elisa/-/merge_requests. If you aren't familiar
with this process, you can learn how to do it [here](https://community.kde.org/Infrastructure/GitLab#Submitting_a_merge_request).
